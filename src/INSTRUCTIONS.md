Coding Challenge (React & TypeScript) - 60 minutes

Task: Create a React component that displays a list of objects fetched from a provided mock API endpoint.

Requirements:
1. Use TypeScript to define the data structure of the fetched items and the component props.

2. Implement a client-side function that filters the list based on a user input (e.g., search term or status dropdown).

3. Correctly handle API error states and display a user-friendly message if the fetch fails.

4. Demonstrate basic memoization (e.g., using useMemo or useCallback) if the filtering logic is computationally complex or to optimize a component passed down.
